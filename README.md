## My process
    I started with the HTML. Creating a div to act as my flexbox container.
    Then used CSS to style.
    

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BEM
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

The only problem I had with this challenge was centering the text inside the container. I was attempting to use flexbox to center it, eventually I used google to find a solution, and ended up using text-align.

```css
.container__title {
   text-align: center;
}
```

I also had an opportunity to use git and write markdown for the first time.
